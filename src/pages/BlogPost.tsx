        <h2>Understanding Your Question</h2>
        <p>First, we carefully analyze what you're asking. We identify the core concept and any technical jargon that needs to be simplified.</p>

        <h2>Structuring the Explanation</h2>
        <p>Our explanations follow a logical flow: starting with the basics, building up gradually, and ending with a clear summary.</p>
        
        <h2>Continuous Improvement</h2>
        <p>We regularly update our explanations based on feedback to ensure they remain clear, accurate, and helpful.</p>
